# beamerguessr

This is a custom map for https://geoguessr.tk

Possible locations are all the towns which are namesakes for [LaTeX Beamer themes](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/tree/main/base/themes/theme) 

<sub>To make them easier to recognise, the maps mostly contain the inner parts of the towns. Caveat: Bounderies are only rough approximations, in particular in urban areas with grown together cities, the shape might not follow the actual town boarders.</sub>
